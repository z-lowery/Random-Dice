# What Is This Project?
This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements for a webpage that a user can interact
with to simulate rolling 6-sided dice. 

# Functionality 
On launch, 3 dice will be shown. Each die can be rolled individually or simutaniously with the "Roll all dice" button in the bottom left corner. 

When a die is rolling, the number shown will flip randomly for 1 to 2 seconds until it lands on a final 
result, at which point a short animation will play as a visual indicator that it has finished. The number 
of dice on the screen can be also be modified up to 8, with a minimum of 1. 

The purpose of this project was to practice combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with an end product
that is both functional and feels smooth. Hover elements, specific colors, and animations are used to improve
the user experience by making it look and feel good for the user.
